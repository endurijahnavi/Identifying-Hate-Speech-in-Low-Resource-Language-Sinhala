# Identifying-Hate-Speech-in-Low-Resource-Language-Sinhala

## Overview
This repository contains the research and implementation of sentiment analysis in Sinhala, a low-resource language spoken predominantly in Sri Lanka. The project focuses on understanding sentiment in Sinhala text using various machine learning and deep learning models. The goal is to address the challenges associated with sentiment analysis in low-resource languages and contribute to the development of effective tools for this unique linguistic context.

## Abstract
This project explores machine learning and deep learning models, including logistic regression, ensemble learning, and various deep learning architectures, such as BERT, CNN, and LSTM, to address the challenges of sentiment analysis in Sinhala. A combined CNN-LSTM-BERT model for detecting hate speech in Sinhala text is proposed.
